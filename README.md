# Wordle
This is a replication of the popular App Store game by the same name, written in C++ and designed to be played on the desktop.

### Objective
Wordle is simple: You have six chances to guess the five-letter word. Type in a word as a guess, and the game tells you which letters are or arenâ€™t in the word. Try to figure out what the word is in as few guesses as possible.
